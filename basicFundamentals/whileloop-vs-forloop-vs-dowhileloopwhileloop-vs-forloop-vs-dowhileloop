A "while" loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition remains true, 
while A "do-while" loop guarantees that the code block will execute at least once before checking the condition, 
and A "for" loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat a block of code, often iterating through a sequence of values like a list or range
foreach - loop through a block of code for each element in an array

// while //
$counter = 1;
while ($counter <= 5) {
    echo 'Counter:' . $counter . '<br>';
    $counter++;
}

// do while //
do {
    echo 'Counter: ' . $counter . '<br>';
    $counter++;
} while ($counter <= 5);

// for loop //
for ($r = 1; $r <= 5; $r++) {
    echo 'Counter: ' . $r . '<br>';
}

// foreach //
$arr = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Avacado', 'Grapes'];

foreach ($arr as $index => $fruit) {
    echo 'Fruit:' . $index . ': ' . $fruit . '<br>';
}
