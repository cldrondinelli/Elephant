A "while" loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition remains true, 
while A "do-while" loop guarantees that the code block will execute at least once before checking the condition, 
and A "for" loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat a block of code, often iterating through a sequence of values like a list or range
